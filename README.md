# Distributed-Go-Fish  
Distributed version of the card game "Go Fish". The application uses a client-server model to represent the game server and the players, using RPCs for communication. The RAFT algorithm is implemented among the game servers to maintain consistency and availability.  
  
## Usage: 
To run the application, first clone the repository:  
    ```git clone https://github.com/geenasmith/Distributed-Go-Fish.git``` 

Open a terminal and navigate to the ```src``` directory:  
    ```cd src``` 
 
Build the application:  
    ```go build``` 
 
and finally run the game:  
    ```./src``` 
 
The output of the game will be printed out in the terminal.
